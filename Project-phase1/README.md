# Rare Bookstore

This project covers the different phases of a web development cycle. A rare bookstore wants us to develop the website but has some unique challenges that they face. It is essential to use design thinking to help them assess the problem.

## Stage 1: Empathize

Empathize is the first stage of the process. Design
teams conduct research to get personal grasps of
their users’ needs. They set aside assumptions to
obtain insights into the users’ world by observing
and consulting with users. This way, they can
understand users’ experiences, motivations and
problems

### Scenario

Employees at a rare bookstore need to access a system where they can store the inventory for the store. The design should be accessible from either a laptop or a tablet. Employees should add, update, and delete books from the system. Not all employees should be able to delete books from the system.

**Stage 1**: Emphasize lesson is a PowerPoint presentation about user personas, notes taken during the interview, and a pdf file.

## Stage 2: Define

Define - accumulate the information gathered
during the Empathize stage. Analyze the
observations and synthesize them to define the
core problems you and your team have identified.
These definitions are called problem statements.
You can create personas to help keep your efforts
human-centered before proceeding to ideation.

**Stage 2**: in the Define lesson, we take the interview and find the problems that need to be solved. Included is another PowerPoint presentation inside.

## Stage 3: Ideate

Look for alternative ways to view the problem and identify
innovative solutions to the problem statement you’ve
created. Challenge Assumptions and Create Ideas.

##Stage 3

The Ideate stage is really for cementing ideas. Making sure everything makes sense and trying to hit the solutions to the problems. This is also the time to put egos aside and get a feel of what really needs to be done.

**Stage 3**: Included with this lesson is a powerpoint presentation and pdf of the ideas. 

##Stage 4

Creating protoypes of the project is very hard to do but worth it. This is important because this can be the area were money can be wasted. It is also were experimentation can be done
without too mush worry about the desing budget. This is the place to take risks.

**Stage4**: Included is a prototype-test folder including the html and css as well as the powerpoint presentation.

##Stage 5

The testing stage is where good ideas come to die. No, but seriously. The dreams and design choices can really be tested in this stage. It is good to test and test and test again because sometimes solutions can be where you least expect it.

**stage5** Included in this is the folder prototype-test folder that has all of the notes and files that were tested. there is also a powerpoint demonstration.
