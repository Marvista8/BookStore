# Rare Book Store

This project covers the different phases of a web development cycle. A rare bookstore wants us to develop the website but has some unique challenges that they face. It is essential to use design thinking to help them assess the problem. For phase 1, we will focus on Empathy. We need to empathize with the client to understand their pain points and immediate needs.
