# Rare Book Store

This project covers the different phases of a web development cycle. A rare bookstore wants us to develop the website but has some unique challenges that they face. It is essential to use design thinking to help them assess the problem. For phase 1, we will focus on Empathy. We need to empathize with the client to understand their pain points and immediate needs.

## Phase 1: Empathize

### Scenario

Employees at a rare bookstore need to be able to access a system where they can
store the inventory for the store. The system should be accessible from either a laptop
or a tablet. Employees should be able to add, update, and delete books from the
system. Not all employees should be able to delete books from the system.
